# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @NikhilHadke

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Nikhil, and I'm passionate about software test Engineering, automation testing, software development, and data science.

## üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in ...

I have a keen interest in several areas of technology, and some of my key interests include:

- **Automation Testing:** I have a strong background in automated testing and quality assurance. I specialize in using tools like Selenium for web automation, Maven for project management, and TestNG for test execution. I find satisfaction in building robust test suites that ensure software reliability.

- **Development Tools:** I'm proficient in using development tools like Eclipse as my primary Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java projects. I also have experience with other IDEs like Visual Studio Code. I believe the right tools make development more efficient and enjoyable.

- **Programming Languages:** I'm skilled in Java, which I often use for developing automation scripts and applications. Java's versatility and robustness make it one of my favorite languages.

- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** I'm well-versed in setting up and configuring CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins. These pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying applications, leading to faster development cycles and more reliable software.

- **Version Control:** I'm a strong advocate for using GitHub for version control and collaboration. I believe that good version control practices are essential for efficient teamwork and project management.

My passion lies in leveraging these interests to solve real-world problems, contribute to open-source projects, and collaborate with like-minded individuals in the tech community. If you share any of these interests or are working on exciting projects in these areas, I'd love to connect and explore potential collaborations.

## üå± I‚Äôm currently learning ...

As a tech enthusiast, I believe in the importance of continuous learning and staying updated with the ever-evolving technology landscape. Currently, I'm focused on enhancing my skills and knowledge in the following areas:

- **Test Automation:** Automation testing is an area that's always evolving. I'm continually honing my skills in test automation tools such as Selenium and TestNG to keep up with industry best practices and ensure that the software I work on is of the highest quality.

- **DevOps and CI/CD:** The DevOps culture and CI/CD practices are vital in today's software development world. I'm actively learning more about configuring
  and optimizing CI/CD pipelines with tools like Jenkins to streamline the software development lifecycle and improve collaboration within development teams.

This ongoing learning journey is not only about acquiring new technical skills but also about developing a mindset of curiosity and adaptability. I'm enthusiastic about applying my newfound knowledge to real-world projects and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the tech world.
